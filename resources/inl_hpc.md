# Apply to INL HPC Account

Please, note that the instructions below do not guarantee you will get access, but you have to apply first to tell. All members of the AIMS groups have been granted access to INL HPC clusters so far. Do the following steps:

- Go to the [INL NCRC](https://inl.gov/ncrc/) and create a user account.
- Fill your personal information in the account and they may ask you to upload some ID proof. For international students, you may be asked to upload your passport ID page and the visa page. 
- Go to request an HPC account
- Pick Matthew Willam Anderson as your host.
- In 100 words describe what is your research about. You should have discussed that with Prof. Radaideh before or at least have an idea of why you need HPC.
- At the end of your research summary, mention that you will work with Prof. Radaideh at Michigan and mention his email (radaideh@umich.edu) as a contact if they have additional questions about your research.

US citizens have typically a faster review process while international students have to pass through an additional processing step that takes 4 weeks on average. Therefore, you are encouraged to apply early. 

## Things you should not do

- There is a section where they ask you to fill out organizational documents that include the institution address and other administrative information. These documents should not be filled by you and were already done by the university.
- Do not go to the tab **Request Licensed Software** and apply to a nuclear code. You should first discuss with Prof. Radaideh whether you need that software or not.
